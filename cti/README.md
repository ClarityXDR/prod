- **Executive Reporting**: Automated daily/weekly summaries for management

## üìà Integration Examples

### MDCA Risky IP Integration
```powershell
# Automatically creates MDCA policies for malicious IPs
Set-MDCAPolicy -IPAddress "192.168.1.100" -Description "Known C2 server" -Severity "High"
# Result: IP marked as risky category with governance actions applied
```

### Entra ID Named Location with Complete Blocking
```powershell
# Creates Named Location + Conditional Access policy for complete sign-in blocking
Add-EntraNamedLocation -IPAddress "192.168.1.100" -Description "CTI Malicious IP"
# Result: All users blocked from signing in from this IP address
```

### Exchange Online Protection
```powershell
# Adds to connection filter for immediate email blocking
Add-ExchangeConnectionFilterIP -IPAddress "192.168.1.100"
# Result: All email from this IP immediately rejected
```
