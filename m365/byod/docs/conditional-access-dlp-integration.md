# Comprehensive Conditional Access Policies for DLP Integration

## 1.0 Overview and Principles

This document defines the comprehensive Conditional Access policy architecture that integrates SharePoint Online DLP, Exchange Online DLP, and session controls to create a unified data protection framework for BYOD scenarios. These policies serve as the enforcement layer that coordinates between different Microsoft 365 services to ensure consistent data protection.

The architecture is founded on these core principles:

- **Unified Enforcement**: Single policy framework that coordinates DLP across all Microsoft 365 services
- **Device Context Awareness**: Different protection levels based on device management status
- **Risk-Based Controls**: Dynamic protection based on user, sign-in, and device risk signals
- **Service Integration**: Seamless coordination between Conditional Access, SharePoint, Exchange, and MDCA
- **Business Enablement**: Maintain productivity while enforcing appropriate security controls

## 2.0 Policy Architecture Framework

### 2.1 Core Policy Structure

The Conditional Access policies are designed as a layered approach that provides comprehensive coverage while avoiding policy conflicts:

1. **Foundational Policies**: Basic access controls for all scenarios
2. **Service-Specific Policies**: Tailored controls for SharePoint, Exchange, and other services
3. **Risk-Based Policies**: Dynamic controls based on risk assessment
4. **High-Value Asset Policies**: Enhanced protection for critical data and systems

### 2.2 Policy Coordination Matrix

| Service | Managed Devices | Unmanaged Devices | High Risk | Emergency Access |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|-----------|------------------|
| SharePoint | Monitor + Audit | Session Controls + DLP | Block/Step-up | Break-glass only |
| Exchange | Standard DLP | Enhanced DLP + OWA restrictions | Read-only/Block | Break-glass only |
| General M365 | Standard access | Browser-only + MDCA | MFA + restrictions | Break-glass bypass |
