# SharePoint Online Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Architecture

## 1.0 Overview and Principles

This document defines the architecture for SharePoint Online Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies as part of the comprehensive BYOD security solution. SharePoint DLP provides content-level protection for documents and files stored in SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business, working in coordination with Conditional Access and session controls to create a unified data protection framework.

The architecture is founded on these core principles:

- **Content-Centric Protection**: Protect sensitive data based on content classification and sensitivity labels
- **Granular Control**: Apply different protection levels based on content sensitivity and user context
- **User Education**: Provide contextual guidance when users encounter DLP restrictions
- **Business Continuity**: Balance security with productivity through appropriate exception mechanisms
- **Compliance Integration**: Align with regulatory requirements and organizational policies
