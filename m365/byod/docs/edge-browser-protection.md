# Microsoft Edge for Business Browser Protection Architecture

## 1.0 Overview and Principles

This document defines the architecture for Microsoft Edge for Business browser protections as part of the comprehensive BYOD security solution. Edge for Business provides enhanced browser-based security controls that work in coordination with session policies and endpoint protection to create a unified security framework.

The architecture is founded on these core principles:

- **Native Browser Protection**: Security controls built directly into the browser for enhanced performance and user experience
- **Work Profile Isolation**: Strict separation between personal and work browsing contexts
- **Seamless Integration**: Deep integration with Microsoft 365 and security services
- **Enhanced Enforcement**: Stronger security controls than traditional proxy-based solutions
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Continuous verification and adaptive protection based on risk context
