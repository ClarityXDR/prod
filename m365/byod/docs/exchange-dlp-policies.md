# Exchange Online Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Architecture

## 1.0 Overview and Principles

This document defines the architecture for Exchange Online Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies as part of the comprehensive BYOD security solution. Exchange DLP provides email-level protection for sensitive information in transit and at rest, working in coordination with Conditional Access and Outlook Web Access controls to create a unified email security framework.

The architecture is founded on these core principles:

- **Email-Centric Protection**: Protect sensitive data within email messages, attachments, and metadata
- **Transport-Level Security**: Inspect and control emails during transport and delivery
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure compliance with industry regulations and data protection laws
