# ClarityXDR Cost Optimization Guide

This guide provides comprehensive strategies for optimizing costs while maintaining security effectiveness in your ClarityXDR deployment.

## Overview

ClarityXDR includes advanced cost optimization features through Microsoft Sentinel All-In-One V3, designed to reduce operational costs by up to 40% while maintaining full security coverage.

## Multi-Tier Storage Strategy

### Storage Tiers Explained

| Tier | Use Case | Cost | Query Performance | Retention |
|------|----------|------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Standard** | Active security data | High | Fastest | 90 days |
| **Auxiliary** | Medium-priority logs | Medium | Fast | 365 days |
| **Basic** | Compliance/Archive | Low | Slower | 2+ years |

### Automatic Data Tiering

```yaml
# Data Tiering Configuration
Standard Tier (Hot):
  - High-severity alerts
  - Authentication events
  - Critical system logs
  - Real-time threat intelligence

Auxiliary Tier (Warm):
  - Network traffic logs
  - Application logs
  - Medium-severity events
  - Historical analytics data

Basic Tier (Cold):
  - Compliance logs
  - Audit trails
  - Long-term storage
  - Archived investigations
```

### Implementation

```powershell
# Configure data tiering policies
$WorkspaceName = "ClarityXDR-Workspace"
$ResourceGroup = "ClarityXDR-RG"

# Set table retention and tiering
az monitor log-analytics workspace table update \
  --resource-group $ResourceGroup \
  --workspace-name $WorkspaceName \
  --name "SecurityEvent" \
  --retention-time 90 \
  --total-retention-time 365
```

## Data Collection Optimization

### Smart Data Collection Rules (DCRs)

DCRs filter unnecessary data before ingestion, significantly reducing costs:

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "dataFlows": [
      {
        "streams": ["Microsoft-SecurityEvent"],
        "destinations": ["ClarityXDR-Workspace"],
        "transformKql": "SecurityEvent | where EventLevelName != 'Informational' | where EventID in (4624, 4625, 4648, 4656, 4672, 4697, 4698, 4699, 4700, 4701, 4702)"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Log Type Optimization

| Log Type | Standard Collection | Optimized Collection | Cost Savings |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Windows Security Events | All events | Filtered critical events | 60-70% |
| Entra ID Sign-ins | All sign-ins | Failed + High-risk only | 40-50% |
| Network Traffic | All connections | Suspicious traffic only | 50-60% |
| Office 365 Activity | All activities | Security-relevant only | 30-40% |

### Implementation Example

```powershell
# Configure optimized data collection for Windows Security Events
$DCRName = "ClarityXDR-SecurityEvents-Optimized"
$WorkspaceId = "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/ClarityXDR-RG/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/ClarityXDR-Workspace"

# Create DCR with filtering
az monitor data-collection-rule create \
  --resource-group "ClarityXDR-RG" \
  --name $DCRName \
  --rule-file "dcr-optimized-security-events.json"
```

## Cost Monitoring & Alerting

### Interactive Cost Dashboard

Access the built-in cost monitoring dashboard:

1. Navigate to **Microsoft Sentinel > Workbooks**
2. Open **ClarityXDR Cost Optimization Dashboard**
3. Review daily/monthly cost trends
4. Identify optimization opportunities

### Automated Cost Alerts

```powershell
# Create cost alert for daily ingestion over threshold
az monitor metrics alert create \
  --name "ClarityXDR-DailyCostAlert" \
  --resource-group "ClarityXDR-RG" \
  --scopes "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/ClarityXDR-RG/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/ClarityXDR-Workspace" \
  --condition "total DataUsageByApplication > 10GB" \
  --window-size "1d" \
  --evaluation-frequency "1h" \
  --action-group "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/ClarityXDR-RG/providers/Microsoft.Insights/actionGroups/ClarityXDR-Alerts"
```

### Budget Configuration

```powershell
# Set monthly budget with alerts
az consumption budget create \
  --resource-group "ClarityXDR-RG" \
  --budget-name "ClarityXDR-Monthly" \
  --amount 1000 \
  --time-grain "Monthly" \
  --time-period start-date="2025-01-01" \
  --notifications amount=500,operator="GreaterThan",threshold=50,contact-emails="admin@company.com"
```

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Data Source Prioritization

**High Priority (Standard Tier)**:
- Authentication failures and successes
- Privilege escalation events
- Malware detections
- Network intrusion attempts
- Critical system events

**Medium Priority (Auxiliary Tier)**:
- General network traffic
- Application logs
- Performance counters
- File access events
- Process creation events

**Low Priority (Basic Tier)**:
- Informational events
- Verbose application logs
- Historical compliance data
- Audit trails
- Backup logs

### 2. Query Optimization

Optimize KQL queries for cost-effective analysis:

```kql
// EXPENSIVE: Scanning all data
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where Account contains "admin"

// OPTIMIZED: Using indexed columns and time filters
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)  // Reduced time range
| where EventID in (4624, 4625)  // Specific event IDs
| where Account has_any ("admin", "administrator")  // Optimized string search
```

### 3. Retention Policy Optimization

```powershell
# Configure table-specific retention
$Tables = @{
    "SecurityEvent" = 90
    "SigninLogs" = 30
    "AuditLogs" = 365
    "Heartbeat" = 7
    "Perf" = 30
}

foreach ($Table in $Tables.GetEnumerator()) {
    az monitor log-analytics workspace table update \
        --resource-group "ClarityXDR-RG" \
        --workspace-name "ClarityXDR-Workspace" \
        --name $Table.Key \
        --retention-time $Table.Value
}
```

## Industry-Specific Optimizations

```

## Cost Analysis & Reporting

### Daily Cost Analysis

```kql
// Daily ingestion cost analysis
Usage
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where IsBillable == true
| summarize DataGB = sum(Quantity) / 1000, Cost = sum(Quantity) * 2.30 / 1000 by bin(TimeGenerated, 1d), DataType
| render timechart
```

### Top Cost Contributors

```kql
// Identify highest cost data sources
Usage
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| where IsBillable == true
| summarize DataGB = sum(Quantity) / 1000 by DataType
| order by DataGB desc
| take 10
```

### ROI Analysis

```kql
// Security incidents prevented vs. cost
let TotalCost = 1000; // Monthly Sentinel cost
let IncidentsPrevented = 15; // Incidents caught and prevented
let AvgIncidentCost = 50000; // Average cost of security incident
let ROI = (IncidentsPrevented * AvgIncidentCost - TotalCost) / TotalCost * 100;
print ROI_Percentage = ROI
```

## Automation & Optimization

### Automated Cost Optimization

```powershell
# Azure Automation runbook for cost optimization
param(
    [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
    [string]$WorkspaceId,
    
    [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
    [string]$ResourceGroup
)

# Get high-volume, low-value data sources
$HighVolumeQuery = @"
Usage
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| where IsBillable == true
| summarize DataGB = sum(Quantity) / 1000 by DataType
| where DataGB > 10
| order by DataGB desc
"@

$Results = Invoke-AzOperationalInsightsQuery -WorkspaceId $WorkspaceId -Query $HighVolumeQuery

# Recommend optimizations
foreach ($Result in $Results.Results) {
    if ($Result.DataType -eq "Perf" -and $Result.DataGB -gt 50) {
        Write-Output "RECOMMENDATION: Consider reducing performance counter collection frequency"
    }
    elseif ($Result.DataType -eq "W3CIISLog" -and $Result.DataGB -gt 20) {
        Write-Output "RECOMMENDATION: Filter IIS logs to security-relevant entries only"
    }
}
```
